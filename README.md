# ⚙️ 2. Architecture overview
The Simple Calculator application is designed with a modular structure that separates the user interface from the core logic:
- src/main.rs – Connects the UI with the calculation logic and handles user interactions.
- src/calc.rs – Implements the core calculation logic and unit tests.
- src/ui.slint – Defines the user interface layout and styling using Slint.
- assets/Screenshot app.png – Contains static resources such as the app screenshot.
